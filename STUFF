GOAL: 
- Expose Roaster resources using Grape
- Fewest lines of code possible to achieve that
- Retain configurability nonetheless
- Expose params too (useful if using something like swagger) (not sure if possible)
- We like roasted chicken

MAYBE:
- Handle authentication and forward to Roaster for authorization

Example:

class API < Grape::API
  GrapeRoaster.expose AlbumMapping
end

Equals to:

class API < Grape::API
  resource :albums do

    post '/' do
      ...
    end

    get '/' do
      ...
    end

    route_param :album_id do

      get '/' do
        ...
      end

      put '/' do
        ...
      end
  
      delete '/' do
        ...
      end

    end

  end
end
